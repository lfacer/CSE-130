# 1. Name:
#      Lyndsey Facer
# 2. Assignment Name:
#      Lab 04: Monopoly
# 3. Assignment Description:
#      This program is designed to see if the user is able to place a hotel down on Pennsylvania avenue.
#      It asks the user several questions to get to the final conculsion as fast as possible.
#      It takes into accound, the amount of money and houses and hotels that are all avalible.
# 4. What was the hardest part? Be as specific as possible.
#      Was it the syntax of Python?
#      Was it an aspect of the problem you are to solve?
#      Was it the instructions or any part of the problem definition?
#      Was it the submission process?
#      I thought that the hardest part of this lab was how many different options you have to account for,
#      and the over all size of the program. I think that all of the decisions were pretty simple,
#      just basic if and elif statements. I did have a tiny bit of trouble with remebering syntax and keeping
#      things organized. But other than that nothing to tricky.
# 5. How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
#      This took me roughly 3 hours to complete. Nothing to hard, just a lot to take into consideration.
